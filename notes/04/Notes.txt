** props -  short form for properties
 - props is an Object
 - passing props to component is like a passing arguments to the JavaScript function


 - desctructing on the fly

 ** Config Driven UI - Controlling the UI from data

 ** Wherever use map or loop/iteration then it must be use key props
    key should be unique
** indexes for keys are bad practice and don't recommended
Only use if there is no unique key
 No using keys (not acceptable) <<<<  index as key <<<<<<<<<<<  unique id
